Frequent physical challenges are used to pit the tribes against each other for Rewards, such as food or luxuries, or for \"Immunity\", forcing the other tribe to attend \"Tribal Council\", where they must vote off one of their players. Once about half the players are remaining, the tribes are merged into a single tribe, and competitions are on an individual basis; winning Immunity prevents that player from being voted out, while several that are voted out at this stage form the game's \"Jury\". Once down to two or three people, a Final Tribal Council is held where the remaining players plead their case to the jury members. The jury then votes for which player should be considered the \"Sole Survivor\" and win the $1 million prize. Survivor has introduced numerous modifications, or \"twists\", on the core rules in order to keep the players on their toes and to prevent players from relying on strategies that succeeded in prior seasons. These changes have included tribal switches, seasons starting with more than two tribes, the ability to exile a player from a tribe for a short time, Hidden Immunity Idols that players can use to save themselves at Tribal Council and a chance to return to regular gameplay after elimination through \"Redemption

Once about half the players are remaining, the tribes are merged into a single tribe, and competitions are on an individual basis; winning Immunity prevents that player from being voted out, while several that are voted out at this stage form the game's \"Jury\". Once down to two or three people, a Final Tribal Council is held where the remaining players plead their case to the jury members. The jury then votes for which player should be considered the \"Sole Survivor\" and win the $1 million prize. Survivor has introduced numerous modifications, or \"twists\", on the core rules in order to keep the players on their toes and to prevent players from relying on strategies that succeeded in prior seasons. These changes have included tribal switches, seasons starting with more than two tribes, the ability to exile a player from a tribe for a short time, Hidden Immunity Idols that players can use to save themselves at Tribal Council and a chance to return to regular gameplay after elimination through \"Redemption Island\".","first_aired":"2000-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","airs":{"day":"Wednesday","time":"20:00","timezone":"America/New_York"},"runtime":45,"certification":"TV-PG","network":"CBS","country":"us","trailer":"http://youtube.com/watch?v=DJXg9p_5Br4","homepage":"http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/","status":"returning series","rating":7.45046,"votes":1423,"comment_count":12,"updated_at":"2017-12-09T11:43:09.000Z","language":"en","available_translations":["ar","bg","de","en","es","fi","id","km","lb","ms","ro","tr"],"genres":["reality"],"aired_episodes":526}},{"watchers":11,"show":{"title":"Fargo","year":2014,"ids":{"trakt":60203,"slug":"fargo","tvdb":269613,"imdb":"tt2802850","tmdb":60622,"tvrage":35276},"overview":"An american black comedy–crime drama anthology television series created and primarily written by Noah Hawley.

Frequent physical challenges are used to pit the tribes against each other for Rewards, such as food or luxuries, or for \"Immunity\", forcing the other tribe to attend \"Tribal Council\", where they must vote off one of their players. Once about half the players are remaining, the tribes are merged into a single tribe, and competitions are on an individual basis; winning Immunity prevents that player from being voted out, while several that are voted out at this stage form the game's \"Jury\". Once down to two or three people, a Final Tribal Council is held where the remaining players plead their case to the jury members. The jury then votes for which player should be considered the \"Sole Survivor\" and win the $1 million prize. Survivor has introduced numerous modifications, or \"twists\", on the core rules in order to keep the players on their toes and to prevent players from relying on strategies that succeeded in prior seasons. These changes have included tribal switches, seasons starting with more than two tribes, the ability to exile a player from a tribe for a short time, Hidden Immunity Idols that players can use to save themselves at Tribal Council and a chance to return to regular gameplay after elimination through \"Redemption Island\".","first_aired":"2000-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","airs":{"day":"Wednesday","time":"20:00","timezone":"America/New_York"},"runtime":42,"certification":"TV-PG","network":"CBS","country":"us","trailer":"http://youtube.com/watch?v=DJXg9p_5Br4","homepage":"http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/","status":"returning series","rating":7.4506,"votes":1427,"comment_count":12,"updated_at":"2017-12-17T11:03:55.000Z","language":"en","available_translations":["ar","bg","de","en","es","fi","id","km","lb","ms","ro","tr"],"genres":["reality"],"aired_episodes":527}},{"watchers":13,"show":{"title":"Longmire","year":2012,"ids":{"trakt":43659,"slug":"longmire","tvdb":253491,"imdb":"tt1836037","tmdb":43901,"tvrage":null},"overview":"Walt Longmire is the dedicated and unflappable sheriff of Absaroka County, Wyoming.

Using a unique 90-day fiance visa -- the K-1 visa -- four women will travel to the U.S. to live with their overseas fiances for the first time. The couples must marry before their visas expire in 90 days, or the visiting fiancees have to return home. The women will have to overcome language barriers, culture shock, the stigma of the \"mail order bride,\" and skeptical friends and family -- all with a clock that starts the moment they step foot on U.S. soil. Rolling the dice on a cross-border romance, we discover whether these foreign brides-to-be can find their happily ever after in America.
